# Light Projects

A collection of lighting projects controlled by microcontrollers.

## Fading
Light doesn't change in a linear fashion, and the human eye doesn't respond to light in a linear fashion. It's helpful to have a few non-linear formulas for fading light when you're controlling light from a computer. The [fading examples here](fading.md) show you a few different fade curves and how to create them in software.

## Non-Addressable Strip Control
Single-channel and multi-channel LED strips are very popular these days, and pretty easy to control with a microcontroller and a few transistors. 

You can find LED strips in a variety of combinations:
* Red/Green/Blue (RGB)
* Red/Green/Blue/White (RGBW). These come in cool white, warm white, and natural white variations.
* Tunable White. These come in a variety of styles: Warm/cool white, Warm/cool/natural white, and White/white/amber

## Addressable Strip Control
There are a number of addressable LED models on the market now, and they come in a variety of form factors. Covered here are a couple of the most popular, the WS28xx/SK68xx LEDs, and the APA102C LEDs. Adafruit calls their products with these NeoPixels and DotStars, respectively. SparkFun calls their APA102C line Lumenati. Whatever you call them, they're useful to know about. 

Addressable strips can be found in the many of the same variations as non-addressable strips, including RGB, RGBW, RGBAW, and WWA.
