# Controlling LED Strips

## What Kind of LED Strip Is This?
LED strips are easy to come by these days, and often you get them without documentation, or you lose the label. In those cases, it's easy to be confused about what you've got. Here are a few common things to look for:

* +12V/+24V
* R, G, B, A, W, WW, P
* VCC, DI, CI, DO, CO, GND - APA102
* G, DI, DO, arrow - WS2812

## Electrical and Physical Characteristics
* Channels
* Voltage
* Current
* Wattage
* Density
* Lumen output

## Constant Current sources

## Control lines: common anode or common cathode

## Transistors to Control LED Sources 

A lot of automotive and industrial LED lighting sources are "low voltage DC", meaning that they're lower than the 120V - 240V AC that you get out of a wall socket. You can control 12-24V DC sources with power transistors and MOSFETs from a microcontroller quite easily. There are three models I've used with good results:

### TIP120 Darlington transistor
 These have been a staple in my projects for over two decades. [The TIP120](https://octopart.com/search?q=TIP120) transistor [(datasheet)](https://www.mccsemi.com/pdf/Products/TIP120(TO-220).pdf) is a bipolar transistor, designed for high current inductive loads like motors. Darlington transistors are actually two transistors in one, where the pairing of the two results in higher gain. The TIP120 has a built-in snubber diode to prevent damage from back-voltage generated by motors. You don't actually need these things for controlling LEDs, but what makes the TIP120 useful is that it can control a load up to 60V and 5A and it can be controlled reliably by either a 5V or 3.3V output from a microcontroller. 

 Figure X shows the wiring for a TIP120 Darlington transistor controlling a 12-24V DC LED source.

### FQP30N06L N-Channel MOSFET
A MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) is a slightly more modern transistor, designed specifically for switching applications. Bipolar transistors draw a certain amount of current at the base to switch, while MOSFETs draw almost no current on their gate.  They're ideal for switching LED sources. They are more sensitive to electrostatic discharge than bipolar transistors, though, so you have to be more careful not to accidentally expose them to a static shock. Make sure you've grounded yourself well beforw working with MOSFETs. 

The [FQP30N06L](https://octopart.com/search?q=FQP30N06L) MOSFET [(datasheet)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/FQP30N06L.pdf) is an N-channel MOSFET designed for switching high-speed circuits, and it's perfect for switching LEDs. It can control up to a 60V, 30A load and can be switched from 3.3V or 5V.

### IRLB8721 N-Channel MOSFET

The [IRLB8721](https://octopart.com/search?q=IRLB8721) MOSFET [(datasheet)](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irlb8721pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a40153566056732591) is similar in specs to the FQP30N06L. It too can control up to a 60V, 30A load and can be switched from 3.3V or 5V. The pin configuration for this MOSFET is identical to the FQP30N06L, so Figure X above will work with this part in place of the previous MOSFET with no other change.
